# IOWA-Sales-Analysis

The dataset encompasses a vast amount of information, comprising over 24 million rows. It captures the purchase details of Iowa Class "E" liquor licensees, including product specifics and the corresponding purchase dates. The data spans from January 1, 2012, up until the present.

To begin our analysis, we have employed a Dimensional Model, which consists of Fact and Dimension tables. These tables are constructed based on our data source. To ensure data accuracy and consistency, we utilized Alteryx for Data Profiling. This process enabled us to identify areas requiring data cleaning and correction.

Furthermore, we employed Talend to facilitate the integration of data from diverse sources into one or more consolidated tables. This integration step allows us to combine information from various origins, ensuring a comprehensive and unified dataset for further analysis.
