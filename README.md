# License Sales Analysis

This project analyzes the purchase behavior of Iowa Class "E" liquor licensees, covering detailed information about product purchases and corresponding purchase dates. The dataset contains over **24 million rows**, providing a comprehensive look at liquor sales from **January 1, 2012, to the present**.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Data Source**
   - The dataset encompasses purchase records of Iowa Class "E" liquor licensees, including product details and purchase timestamps.
   - Time Period: January 1, 2012 â€“ Present.
   
### 2. **Data Modeling**
   - We have employed a **Dimensional Model** to structure the data.
   - The model includes **Fact** and **Dimension** tables, created based on the original dataset.
   - This approach supports an efficient and logical structure for conducting our analysis.

### 3. **Data Profiling and Cleaning**
   - **Alteryx** was used to profile the data, helping us identify areas requiring cleaning and correction.
   - Data accuracy and consistency were prioritized to ensure reliable analysis.

### 4. **Data Integration**
   - **Talend** was utilized for integrating data from multiple sources into consolidated tables.
   - This integration step ensures that information from various origins is merged into a unified dataset for more effective analysis.

### 5. **Data Visualization**
   - To visualize the analysis, **Tableau** was used to create interactive dashboards.
   - These visualizations provide insights into sales trends, product performance, and licensee purchase behaviors over time.
